For half a day we were stalking to get an idea or to find a proper human pain.<br>Then,there was a session from sir about the learning styles of schools and spoon-feeding system that&#39;s happening in current scenarios.<br><br>With that he concluded the session by encouraging us to start our own companies and become an entrepreneur.<br>By that,he asked us to come up with the area on which we are focusing and the problem we observed from there.<br><br>Initial plan was to focus on cottonmill, because with the hope that we could spot either one or two problems but that was again tough part.<br>The problem we observed was caring the workers health and the safety. But those two were already picked by other teammates so we thought of dropping it both.<br>Then came the idea of joining two cotton thick threads automatically.
