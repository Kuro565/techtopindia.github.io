So there were 6 teams created by them.

So we done this programing by the use of &ldquo;for loop&rdquo; in arduino</span></p><p class="c2"><span>And at the end of the day we had given a title of </span><span class="c9">mini project 3</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;i.e. Make a learning toy for a toddler for which we have to prepare working model, presentation, video on day 2.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c7"><span class="c5 c10"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">Day 2</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;- </span></p><p class="c3 c7"><span class="c10 c11 c9"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9">Mini Project 3 -</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; we have a project to do that whose theme is on a learning toy for a toddler we have to make a working model of that toy, to give model presentation, power point presentation and we have to make also a video of our product (Toy).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9">Ideation &ndash;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Our idea was to make a learning kit for a toddler and for this we decided to make combination of fun and puzzles so kids can able to identify the shapes and colour with playing with this tool and can improve his/her analysing ability when kid put a right box inside in a right block the toy will also pronounce the name of colour and shape itself and so we made a bus model as a toy and gave it a name &ldquo;LOCK &amp; LEARN&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 623.11px; height: 350.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.jpg" style="width: 623.11px; height: 350.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 50.93px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9">Procedure &ndash; </span><span class="c0">we divided our whole work into a part I prepare a 3D model of bus in sketchup and video of that model and sriram did a coding and programing part, janish made a physical body of that model, dharinni prepared a PPT. we completed our project at around 3 o&#39;clock and at the end we all learn all the things from each other what they did in his/her individual part and after it we all gave a model presentation and powerpoint presentation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9">Digital fabrication &ndash; </span><span class="c0">there was a session in an evening taken by Dhruv Saidava is on to make a proper documentation which can explain our work.

They give all the cow dung and urine to the medical person to use it and what other thing I observed i.e.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That there are the two species of cows available i.e. 1. Jersey and 2. Indian.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There are many differences in these two species.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The jersey cows give a milk count around 35-40 litres milk in a one day of compare to the Indian cow which gives only 5-10 litres a day.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The jersey cow has a sort life span than that of Indian cow as the injection is given to jersey to increase the quantity of milk.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The jersey cow also has a different shape like of its shoulder, horns and neck than Indian cow.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The jersey cows have less protein and calcium in it&rsquo;s milk and other one Indian cows having all these quality in just same quantity of milk and it&rsquo;s milk is also so strong and so good for a born child.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The jersey cow&rsquo;s milk has a low price rate compare to Indian cow.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There is arrangement for the cow food they are using the process hydrophonic to grow the cow food in any climatic condition. they use water for it and produce a corn type food for cow. They also are growing crop there and some of the papaya&rsquo;s trees and they are also growing super naferal grass which has a quality that when we cut that grass it will automatically grow again upto 3 years.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I also noticed about that what problems they are facing while doing that great work i.e.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">When we are feeding seeds to grow a papayas tree than every time rabbit came and eat that seeds so they are failed to grow the papayas. Anyway the farm is surrounded by walls and all the cows are protected.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 313.50px; height: 268.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image4.jpg" style="width: 313.50px; height: 268.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 293.50px; height: 267.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image5.jpg" style="width: 293.50px; height: 267.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9">Introduction</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;game - </span><span>At last in the evening we played a interecting game which is like a wonderful part of that event.
